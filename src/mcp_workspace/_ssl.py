"""Truststore activation helper.

Activates the OS certificate store via the optional ``truststore`` package so
PyGithub (via ``requests``/``urllib3``) honors corporate-proxy CA bundles.

Library safety: :func:`ensure_truststore` MUST NOT be called at import time.
``truststore.inject_into_ssl()`` is a global monkeypatch on
``ssl.SSLContext``; activation is the application entry point's decision,
not this module's.
