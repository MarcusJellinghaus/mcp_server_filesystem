# Update GitHub Issue

Based on our prior `/issue_analyse` discussion, update the GitHub issue with refined content.

**Instructions:**
1. If no issue context is found from prior analysis, respond: "No issue context found. Please run `/issue_analyse <number>` first."

2. First, fetch the current issue content:
```bash
gh issue view <issue_number> --json title,body
```

3. Draft updated issue text with:
   - Clear, concise title
   - Well-structured body with implementation ideas

4. Write the issue body to a temp file (avoids bash escaping issues with markdown):
```python
mcp__workspace__save_file(file_path="issue_body_temp.md", content=body_content)
```

5. Update the issue using `--body-file`:
```bash
gh issue edit <issue_number> --title "NEW_TITLE" --body-file issue_body_temp.md
```

6. Clean up the temp file:
```python
mcp__workspace__delete_this_file(file_path="issue_body_temp.md")
```

**Editing Base Branch:**
- To add a base branch: Insert `### Base Branch` section with the branch name
- To change a base branch: Update the content under the existing section
- To remove a base branch: Delete the entire `### Base Branch` section

The base branch must be a single line. Multiple lines will cause an error during branch creation.

**The updated issue should include:**
- Summary of the requirement
- Discussed implementation approach (concise)
- `## Constraints & Rationale` — non-obvious gotchas and the "why" behind decisions. Skip if none identified.
- `## Decisions` table — decided topics so `/issue_analyse` won't re-ask. Skip if none yet.
